## Chapter 1: Introduction

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a computational model that is inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. The key element of this model is the novel structure of the information processing system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurons) working in unison to solve specific problems. ANNs, like people, learn by example. An ANN is configured for a specific application, such as pattern recognition or data classification, through a learning process. Learning in biological systems involves adjustments to the synaptic connections that exist between the neurons. This is true of ANNs as well.

### About Artificial Intelligence

The concept of intelligence is difficult to define, this concept are described as an undefined concept. Below are a list of habilites that define an machine as intelligent:

- ability to make inferences and solve problems

- ability to plan

- ability to accumulate and apply knowledge

- ability to understand natural language

- ability to learn with and without supervision

- ability to perceive sensory information

The two last itens are most related to ANNs.

#### Knowledge Representation

The accumulated knowledge in a machine can take a declarative context or procedural context. Declarative knowledge is the knowledge that can be expressed in a declarative sentence or as a fact. Procedural knowledge is the knowledge that can be expressed as a procedure or a recipe. Declarative context can be strongly represented in Prolog.

### Reasoning   

We can express reasoning as the capability to search process in a state of possible actions and states. Actions are maintained by operators, and operators are used to change the state of the system. Each state can maintain a finite number of actions.

### Learning

- Generalization: The ability to apply knowledge to new situations.

- Discrimination: The ability to distinguish between different situations.

- Induction: The ability to infer general rules from specific examples.

- Instruction: The ability to learn from a teacher.

Basically we can define a machine learning process as the following above. Machine learning has two main types: The first is based on symbolic representation, involves representing knowledge through symbols or rules and using sequential logical inference to learn and make decisions. This method requires a search engine to integrate new knowledge into the existing base and deduce implicit facts. It is used in systems such as medical diagnosis and natural language processing, but faces challenges in encoding knowledge into rules and dealing with ambiguities. This type of learning is considered supervised learning, because it's required a set of labeled data to learn the relationships between symbols or rules and desired outcomes. Labeled data provides examples for the algorithm to learn to associate specific inputs with correct outputs. The second type of machine learning is based on connectionist representation, which involves representing knowledge through interconnected nodes and using parallel processing to learn and make decisions. This type requires an algorithm to adjust the weights of connections between nodes to minimize errors and improve performance. It is used in systems such as pattern recognition and data classification, but faces challenges in training large networks and dealing with overfitting.

### Short History of Neural Networks

Developed in 40's by Walter Pits and McCulloch. The idea behind was make an interconnection beetwen biological neurons and eletronical circuits.

In 1956, Artificial Inteligence(IA) was divided in two main areas: symbolic representation and connectionist representation. The first one was based on symbolic representation, and the second one was based on connectionist representation.

In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt developed the Perceptron. However Marvin Minsky and Seymor Papert showed that the Perceptron was limited to solve linear problems. a perceptron with a single layer can't solve problems usign XOR operator, for example.

### Benefits and Limitations of Neural Networks

Thanks to the massively parallel structure of neural networks and their excellent generalization ability, it is possible to produce suitable outputs for inputs that were not present during training. This capability distinguishes itself from many other algorithms. For complex problems, the network is not capable of learning alone, making it necessary to break the complex problem into simple problems. This requires integration with a traditional algorithm. Learning then cannot be something completely connectionist until now.

A network may be able to adjust its weights in real time, distinguishing itself from non-stationary universes. However this can be a problem, because an neural network requires a lot of computational power and a lot of data to learn. They are also called data-hungry algorithms.

One of the biggest disadvantages of neural networks is the fact that many types of them be "black box" algorithms, which means that is impossible to know how the network is making decisions. This can be a problem in some areas, like medicine, for example. Also it's impossible know the weight relation between the inputs and outputs. It's only possible to know if the network works well making analysis using square mean error, for example.

### Answers

1. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence.

2. A smart machine should be able to make inferences and solve problems, plan, accumulate and apply knowledge, understand natural language, learn with and without supervision, perceive sensory information.

3. A smart system is a system that can make decisions and take actions based on knowledge and reasoning. It can be based on symbolic representation or connectionist representation. It can learn from examples or from a teacher. It can generalize, discriminate, induce, and instruct.

4. Learning is an undefined concept that involves the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or teaching. The most common concept suggests that the simplest of changes that occur in a system, where all the weights are changed to adjust to this new change, is considered a learning process.

5. The advantages of neural networks are their massively parallel structure, excellent generalization ability, and real-time weight adjustment. The disadvantages are their data-hungry nature, the need to break complex problems into simple problems, and their black box nature.

6. The XOR problem is a problem that a perceptron with a single layer cannot solve. The perceptron is limited to solving linear problems, and the XOR problem is a non-linear problem. The XOR problem is a problem that requires a multi-layer perceptron to solve.
