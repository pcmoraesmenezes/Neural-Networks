### Convolutional Neural Networks üéØ

Used for computer vision. Also is the reason why we can build self-driving cars. They are better than SVM.

To better train this type o neural network we should extract the features from the images. Example: We want to predict if is or not homer simpson. We should extract the format of the face, the eyes, the mouth, etc. However in this step we should take care of extract the features that are general and not specific to the image.

Dense neural netwoorks are not good for images because the time to train is too high. Imagine a 32x32 image. If we build a dense neural network we would have 3072 input neurons. This would be a lot of weights to train.

#### Convolutional operator

Process of add each image element to the respective neighboor. Weights are based on kernel. 

The image is a matrix and the kernel is the other matrix.

$$ (f*g)[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} f[m]g[n-m] $$

The kernel is the result of pre processing the image. The kernel is the filter.

#### Pooling

Pooling is the process of highlight features in the image. This process also reduces the image size.

So basic the steps of a convolutional neural network are:

Image -> feature detector -> feature map -> activation function -> Max pooling -> Flattening -> Full connection

#### Flattening

Flattening is the process of convert the matrix into a vector.
