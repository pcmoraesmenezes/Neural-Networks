# Deep Learning With Pytorch

## Description üí°

This README contains the following course:

- [Deep Learning With Pytorch](https://www.udemy.com/course/formacao-deep-learning-pytorch-python/)

## Table of Contents üìö

I divided the course into projects, and each project has it own porpuse. The topics are:

### Binary Classification üéØ

- [Project 1 - Breast Cancer classification](/Courses/Deep%20Learning%20With%20Pytorch/Project_1.ipynb)

- [Project 2 - Binary classification brest cancer with cross validation and dropout](/Courses/Deep%20Learning%20With%20Pytorch/Project_2.ipynb)

- [Project 3 - Binary classification for brest cancer with tuning](/Courses/Deep%20Learning%20With%20Pytorch/Project_3.ipynb)

- [Project 4 - Based on Grid Search best params train with all data](/Courses/Deep%20Learning%20With%20Pytorch/Project_4.ipynb)

- [Project 5 - Loading classifier](/Courses/Deep%20Learning%20With%20Pytorch/Project_5.ipynb)

### Multiclass Classification üéØ

- [Project 6 - Multiclass classifier iris dataset](/Courses/Deep%20Learning%20With%20Pytorch/Project_6.ipynb)

- [Project 7 - Grid Search + Parameter Tuning + DropOut in Iris dataset](/Courses/Deep%20Learning%20With%20Pytorch/Project_7.ipynb)
